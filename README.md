## Description: 
NerdMon is a stylish and simple app for collecting, cataloguing and rating your favorite video games, as well as allowing you to check out the games that your fellow Gamers are playing! 

## Background Information:
As an Avid Gamer and fastidious note taker for most of my formative years, I always wanted a way to digitally catalogue my favorite games.  A way to collect the artwork, leave notes for myself on the things I liked and disliked, in a simple, intuitive and artistic manner that would make the act of cataloguing one's games enjoyable in and of itself.  So I made NerdMon (a play on the word, NodeMon): an app for Nerds, by the King of Nerds.  

## Getting Started:
- Open your preferred browser, navigate to [NerdMon](https://nerdmon-601cc8f61bef.herokuapp.com/) and enjoy!

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Express
- Express-Session
- Mongoose
- BCrypt
- EJS
- NodeMon (obviously)
- GitHub
- Heroku
- VSCode

## Stretch Goals
There were a couple of features I had planned to implement, but ran out of time to do so:
- An additional data entity, tied to the User model, for comments.
- A comment feature, that would allow a user to comment on other community member's games. 
- I wanted to tie my app to the IGDB API.
- I wanted to add a "photo upload" option, as opposed to having to enter image addresses.
